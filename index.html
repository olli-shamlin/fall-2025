            Welcome! This is the website for the *Drivers Ed for the Digital World* course
            offered in Duke OLLI's Fall 2025 term. I am David Shamlin, the instructor for

                        David Shamlin began exploring computers and coding as a teenager. After studying computer
                        science at NC State University, he embarked on a 35-year career in software engineering at SAS
                        Institute. In the last 20 years of his tenure at SAS, working as a research and development
                        director, he led teams implementing distributed platform architectures, big data analytics
                        and cloud computing. In retirement, David enjoys exploring digital technologies that were
                        outside the purview of his professional life. He also greatly enjoys helping others grow their
                        digital literacy. As some wise person once said...
                    <p>
                    <blockquote>
                        Give a man a fish, and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish, and you feed him for a
                        lifetime.
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>
                        David taught two previous Duke OLLI courses:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Fall 2023: Tour of the World Wide Web:
                            <a href="https://olli-shamlin.github.io/fall-2023/">https://olli-shamlin.github.io/fall-2023/</a>
                        </li>
                        <li>Spring 2024: Mastering the Internet:
                            <a href="https://olli-shamlin.github.io/spring-2024/">https://olli-shamlin.github.io/spring-2024/</a>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        If you participated in either of these two courses, you may recognize some overlap in the
                        scope of those courses and this one.  Based on my own learning from participants in the
                        previously conducted courses, I am crafting this one to include some specific differences:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Additional emphasis on devices and apps (with no less emphasis on the Internet and the
                            Cloud.)</li>
                        <li>The notion of "the language of devices and apps" to help you more readily identify and
                            interpret the meaning of icons and controls that commonly appear in apps and on site pages
                            in your browser.</li>
                        <li>Strategies and recommendations for managing your digital life with (what I hope is)
                            increased clarity and confidence.</li>
                    </ul>

            Welcome! This is the website for the *Drivers Ed for the Digital World* course
            offered in Duke OLLI's Fall 2025 term. I am David Shamlin, the instructor for
            this course; you can learn a little more about who I am in the "Instructor" section
            below on this page.
        <p>
            On this website you will find the <a href="https://olli-shamlin.github.io/fall-2025/syllabus.html">
            syllabus</a> and instructor provided materials for the course and its sessions. Click on the words
            "Syllabus" and "Materials" in the banner at the top of your browser window to access their
            content.
        </p>
        <h2>What this course is about</h2>
        <p>
            This course is about the technologies that form the foundation of how we use digital devices (like
            smartphones, tablets, and laptops) and the Internet.  As the course instructor, my primary aim is to
            explain what these things are and how they work. My intent is to increase your understanding of the
            digital domain in ways that enable you to navigate online with more confidence, ease, and comfort.
            Stated another way, my primary goal with this course is to "round out" you current understanding of
            digital technology in a way that reduce the types of obstacles or barriers people often encounter with
            their devices and the internet that result in frustration, consternation, and/or anxiety.
        <p>
            As we learn about the inner workings of devices and the Internet, we will also explore the basics of how
            apps (i.e., software) work and the very critical role data plays in the digital world. We will also explore
            the language of the digital domain. Both acronyms and terms frequently encountered (like, HTTP, URL, IP
            address, and encryption) and also how we communicate to our devices and apps. Believe it or not, our
            devices and apps do have a vernacular but it is rarely discussed or effectively explained outside the
            "geek tribes" (i.e., software engineers, computer scientists, IT admins, etc.)
        <p>
            P.s. and while we're here, we will also explore the (ubiquitous and amorphous) Cloud. While most people
            have heard of "the Cloud", many of those people have such a very limited understanding of what "the Cloud"
            is; they are at a loss to know why they might use it much less how. If you consider yourself to be such a
            person, then for what it's worth and in my humble opinion, that is due in large part to how companies that
            provide cloud capabilities (like Google and Apple) rolled them out to the general public. I.e., they
            released cloud capabilities and features with little more than a "Here you go.  Enjoy!"
        </p>
        <h2>Why "Drivers Ed"?</h2>
        <p>
            While teaching a similar course on the Internet, I asked the students to name one thing about using the
            Internet that that bothered or frustrated them. One person's answer was "new technology being constantly
            thrust upon us." It was their use of the word "thrust" in that moment that really got my attention. I
            believe one of the key reasons people routinely struggle with digital devices stems from this "thrusting"
            of digital products into the personal consumer market with very little effort to explain to their customers
            how they work in ways they enabled their customers to effectively use them.
        <p>
            Compare that aspect of how society treats using digital technology to driving.  To legally drive a vehicle,
            you must have a driver's license; to get a driver's license you must pass some tests to prove you know how
            to effectively and safely operate these machines; and you take a drivers education course to be prepared
            to pass the tests. Drivers Ed courses cover more than how to **operate** vehicles. They cover topics like
            insurance and vehicle maintenance; with regard to safety, they even include information on friction and
            kinetic energy! (I'm not making this up; I found the
                <a href="https://www.dpi.nc.gov/documents/safehealthyschools/driver-ed/driver-education-program-curriculum-guide/open">
                    North Carolina's Standard Curriculum Guide for Driver Ed programs</a>
            online and reviewed it to assure myself this metaphor holds up.)
        <p>
            I planned this course with that metaphor in mind. Just like the classroom portion of a Driver Ed class
            educates students on what key parts of a car are, the purpose they serve, as well as how to safely and
            responsibly use them, I designed this course to help you understand what technology parts are involved
            when you use your digital devices to "go online" as well as how they work. And I am including some
            guidelines and strategies related to safety and privacy (or to extend the Drivers Ed metaphor, how to be a
            defensive driver on the Information Superhighway.
        </p>
        <h2>Is this course right for me?</h2>
        <p>
            I crafted this course for a general audience and am not assuming participants have any specific technical
            knowledge or prior formal training coming into the course. This course suitable for anyone who has a
            need or has an interest to better understand how computers, tablets, smartphones, the Internet, and
            the Cloud work.
        <p>
            While you may have had some training during the course of your career related to using your companies
            computer infrastructure including some applications your company/organization used, unless your career
            was in the digital technology domain and your role routinely entailed using and/or managing computer or
            software systems, you likely have some gaps in your understanding the material in this course can help
            fill. Furthermore, even if career experience did include opportunities for you to learn about digital
            technologies in practical ways, that happened in a commercial business context, while I am framing this
            course's content for the consumer/personal user.

                        David Shamlin began exploring computers and coding as a teenager. After studying computer
                        science at NC State University, he embarked on a 35-year career in software engineering at SAS
                        Institute. In the last 20 years of his tenure at SAS, working as a research and development
                        director, he led teams implementing distributed platform architectures, big data analytics
                        and cloud computing. In retirement, David enjoys exploring digital technologies that were
                        outside the purview of his professional life. He also greatly enjoys helping others grow their
                        digital literacy. As some wise person once said "Give a man a fish, and you feed him for a day.
                        Teach a man to fish, and you feed him for a lifetime."
                    <p>
                        David taught two previous Duke OLLI courses:

                        <li>Fall 2023: Tour of the World Wide Web:

                        </li>

                    <p>
                        If you participated in either of these two courses, you may recognize some overlap in the
                        scope of those courses and this one.  Based on my own learning from participants in the
                        previously conducted courses, I am crafting this one to include some specific differences:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Additional emphasis on devices and apps (with no less emphasis on the Internet and the
                            Cloud.)</li>
                        <li>The notion of "the language of devices and apps" to help you more readily identify and
                            interpret the meaning of icons and controls that commonly appear in apps and on site pages
                            in your browser.</li>
                        <li>Strategies and recommendations for managing your digital life with (what I hope is)
                            increased clarity and confidence.</li>
